# Description

_Shredify is a mobile app built with Angular2 and Ionic that allows users to browse skate spots in their area. User can view spots by panel view or using google maps, and can filter either view using a filter located in the menu. Users can also add their own spot using phone geo-location or google maps marker placement, upload a photo from their phone's camera or gallery, and choose name and features for their spot. The core data of the app is user-driven and stored in firebase._

**A seed.json is supplied with this project if you would like to import it to your own firebase for ease of use.**
